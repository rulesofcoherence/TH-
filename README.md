# THAE 
# THÆ – Temporal Holarchic Asymmetry Engine

> **One geometry. Eight attractors. Ten toroidal modes. Eighteen channels. One asymmetry drifting to φ.**  
> Every persistent system — from DNA to gravity to minds to civilizations — is forced to rediscover the **exact same 8-10-18-φ lattice**.

This is not analogy. It is the algebraic minimum for coherence under divergence-free, volume-preserving, adaptive flow.
